# 🌍 LinguaFlow - Capstone Project

## 📋 Project Overview

This project is a comprehensive serverless translation solution built on AWS that provides both automated file-based translation and real-time API translation. The system automatically processes JSON files uploaded to S3 and provides a RESTful API for instant text translation, all powered by AWS Translate.

## 🚀 Features Implemented

### ✅ Core Functionality
- **Automated S3 File Processing**: Upload JSON files to trigger automatic translation
- **Real-time REST API**: HTTP endpoint for instant text translation
- **Multi-language Support**: Support for 10+ languages with organized folder structure
- **Beautiful Web Interface**: Responsive frontend for easy interaction

### ✅ AWS Services Utilized
- **Amazon S3**: For file storage (request and response buckets)
- **AWS Lambda**: Serverless compute for translation logic
- **AWS Translate**: AI-powered language translation
- **API Gateway**: REST API endpoint for HTTP requests
- **IAM**: Secure role-based permissions
- **CloudWatch**: Logging and monitoring
- **KMS**: Encryption for data at rest

### ✅ Advanced Features
- **Infrastructure as Code**: Complete CloudFormation deployment
- **S3 Event-Driven Architecture**: Automatic triggering of translation workflows
- **CORS Configuration**: Cross-origin resource sharing for web access
- **Language Folder Organization**: Automated file organization by language
- **Error Handling**: Comprehensive error handling and logging

## 🏗️ Architecture

```
User → [Frontend S3 Website] → [API Gateway] → [Lambda] → [AWS Translate]
   ↓
[Upload JSON to S3] → [S3 Event] → [Lambda] → [AWS Translate] → [Save to S3]
```

## 🛠️ Implementation Journey

### Phase 1: Foundation Setup
- Created S3 buckets for request/response storage
- Configured IAM roles and policies for secure access
- Set up AWS CLI and local development environment
- Implemented basic translation logic with Boto3

### Phase 2: Automation & Infrastructure
- Built CloudFormation templates for IaC deployment
- Configured S3 event triggers for Lambda functions
- Implemented error handling and logging
- Set up environment variables and configuration

### Phase 3: API Development
- Created REST API with API Gateway
- Implemented CORS for web application access
- Built frontend interface with JavaScript
- Configured proper HTTP response formats

### Phase 4: Enhancement & Optimization
- Added language-based folder organization
- Implemented KMS encryption for data security
- Optimized Lambda function performance
- Added comprehensive error handling

## ⚠️ Challenges Faced & Solutions

### 🔴 Challenge 1: IAM Permission Issues
**Problem**: Lambda functions failing with AccessDenied errors for S3 and Translate services

**Solution**:
- Created detailed IAM policies with least privilege access
- Used managed policies for basic execution roles
- Implemented thorough testing of permissions

### 🔴 Challenge 2: CloudFormation Rollbacks
**Problem**: Stack deployments failing and entering ROLLBACK_COMPLETE state

**Solution**:
- Simplified templates to minimal working versions
- Used external Lambda code instead of inline scripts
- Implemented gradual enhancement approach

### 🔴 Challenge 3: CORS Configuration
**Problem**: Frontend unable to call API due to CORS restrictions

**Solution**:
- Configured proper CORS settings in API Gateway
- Added CORS headers in Lambda function responses
- Tested with multiple origin configurations

### 🔴 Challenge 4: S3 ACL vs Bucket Policies
**Problem**: AccessControlListNotSupported errors when deploying website

**Solution**:
- Replaced ACL-based permissions with bucket policies
- Implemented proper public read policies
- Maintained security best practices

### 🔴 Challenge 5: API Response Formatting
**Problem**: Frontend receiving unexpected response formats from API Gateway

**Solution**:
- Standardized Lambda response format
- Added proper error handling and status codes
- Implemented consistent JSON parsing

## 🎯 Sample Usage

### File-Based Translation
```bash
# Upload JSON file for automated processing
aws s3 cp violette.json s3://request-bucket-violette/
```

### API Translation
```javascript
// JavaScript API call
const response = await fetch(API_URL, {
    method: 'POST',
    headers: { 'Content-Type': 'application/json' },
    body: JSON.stringify({
        source_language: 'en',
        target_language: 'es', 
        text: 'Hello world'
    })
});
```
